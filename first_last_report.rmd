```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
first_last <- read_tsv("first_last.tsv")
```

Let's quickly see which start-end letter combinations are the most common:

```{r}
first_last %>%
  head(15) %>%
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Start-End", "Number of words"),
               align = "c")
```

We can see that most of the common combinations end with `s`!
